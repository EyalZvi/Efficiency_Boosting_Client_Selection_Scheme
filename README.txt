Hello! 

This is our final project.

In order to run the code the only thing you need to do is to open a new Python project and add the Final_Project.py file to it.



Note - The output of this file consists of two parts:


Part 1: 9 different graphs that open 3 at a time (will pop up once run-time is complete)


Part 2: A logfile consisting of all the client selection choices that have been made throughout the simulation (for all the algorithms)



Thank you for your time and enjoy!
